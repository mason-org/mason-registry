  The best way to utilize the Custom Elements Language Server is to enable the Custom Elements Manifest (CEM) in your
  project by installing a CEM generator like one provided by The Open WC Team.

  Generating a CEM in watch mode will provide you with the best user experience. If your dependencies ship with a Custom
  Elements Manifest, those will be utilized also.
