  Glint is a set of tools to aid in developing code that uses the Glimmer VM for rendering, such as Ember.js v3.24+ and
  GlimmerX projects. Similar to Vetur for Vue projects or Svelte Language Tools, Glint consists of a CLI and a language
  server to provide feedback and enforce correctness both locally during editing and project-wide in CI.
