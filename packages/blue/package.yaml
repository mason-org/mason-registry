  blue is a somewhat less uncompromising code formatter than black, the OG of Python formatters. We love the idea of
  automatically formatting Python code, for the same reasons that inspired black, however we take issue with some of the
  decisions black makes. Kudos to black for pioneering code formatting for Python, and for its excellent implementation.
